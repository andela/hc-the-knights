                        Do you have a friend who is loquacious, 
                        “talking” seemingly ceaselessly? Phone companies love

                        “talkativeness” earns them quite a bit of money.

                        able to throw his “talking” so that it appears to come out 
                        of someone else’s mouth? And does it ever seem that this 
                        loquacious friend is often performing a soliloquy
                        , “talking” all by himself because he does not wait for replies, 
                        jabbering on and on and on … and on?
